        <h2>Eccentria & Eccentricenter</h2>
        <h5>Custom <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> cards and reference site</h5>
        <p>Created 2021, still active</p>       
        <p>
          Designing custom Magic cards is an old hobby of mine. I made a lot when I was a kid from about 2000-2003, and got back into it in 2021. 
          Eccentria was the first set of cards I created in this new era.
        </p>
        <p>
          After playing enough games on Zoom with custom cards, I thought it would be helpful to create a site like 
          <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx">Gatherer</a> for easy card lookups.
          With Eccentricenter, I no longer need to find my copy of Blue Raspberry to read the fine print when my brother plays it.

        <h2>Designer</h2>
        <h5>Automation for bulk editing cards on mtg.design</h5>
        <p>Created in 2021</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://mtg.design">mtg.design</a> is a fantastic site for creating custom Magic: the Gathering cards from any device.
          However, it is not particularly convenient for bulk editing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designer is a command line tool for bulk editing cards on mtg.design. The site doesn't expose any kind of API intended for this kind of automation, so Designer is basically a webscraper.

        <h5><i>Magic: the Gathering</i> inventory tools</h5>
        <p>Created in 2021</p>
        <p>
          These two tools were part of a system I used for tracking my Magic: the Gathering inventory for a while:
          <ul>
            <li>
              I would scan new cards using the mobile app
              <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.tscg.mtgmanager&hl=en_US&gl=US">MTG Scanner - Dragon Shield</a>,
              and then export a CSV from it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Archivist is a command line tool to aggregate a collection of those CSV files representing card transactions into a single inventory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scry is a command line tool that lets you search the inventory generated by Archivist using
              <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/syntax">Scryfall query syntax</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have stopped using or developing these, in favor of a new project, Leng, which I'll post later.

        <p>Created in 2017</p>

          If you've played <i>Minecraft</i> long enough, you've probably planned a big construction project - something like a mob farm or long railway.
          These things take a lot of materials to build, and often the parts are secondary items, not the primitive resources you harvest from the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you might want to build a track with 100 Rails, but you can't typically harvest rails, you have to make them out of sticks and iron ingots. And you can't typically harvest sticks, they must be made from planks, and the planks from logs, which can be harvested. And the iron ingots are made from iron ore plus a little fuel for the smelting process.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how much logs, iron ore, and coal does it take to build 100 rails? You can look up different recipes and figure out the math, but that is time consuming, and also recipes don't mention the amount of fuel required.
        </p>
        <p>
          MineCalc can quickly crunch the numbers for you and determine that...
          <ul>
            <li>100 Rail </li>
            <li> = 100 * (6 Iron Ingot + 1 Stick)</li>
            <li> = 100 * ((6 * (1 Iron Ore + 1/8 Coal)) + (1 * (2/4 Plank)))</li>
            <li> = 100 * ((6 * (1 Iron Ore + 1/8 Coal)) + (1 * (2/4 * (1/4 Wood))))</li>
            <li> = 600 Iron Ore + 75 Coal + 12.5 Wood</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is functional, but the recipes are for Java Edition 1.12 or 1.13, and so many may be out of date.
